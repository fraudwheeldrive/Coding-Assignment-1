# Horiseon code Refactor (assignment-1)

## purpose
Horiseon is a company that offers Social media marketing and Search Engine Optizmization (SEO) services. 
In order to future proof Horiseon's code as well as make it accessable to those who ustilize screen readers
and other assitance and refactoring of the code was needed.

## Scope of Changes 
Html elements were rewritten to utilize semantic elements as provided by HTML5. This allowed the website to be 
logically laid out into distinct sections with names that would make sense to those using screen readers. DIV's 
were renamed to reflect their position and content, website is now broken down into distinct elements, Header, 
Nav, Main, Artcles, Aside and Footer. To go with these changes the appropriate CSS style sheet was adjusted to 
match the new class names. Duplicate CSS code was removed, and the style sheet was re-arragned to follow the flow 
of the new Semantic HTML layout. Please see attached images, initial breakout of HTML was done via a wire frame 
mock up.
